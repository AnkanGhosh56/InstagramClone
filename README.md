Self Projects

This project showcases a basic Instagram clone created using HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the core visual layout and design of Instagram's interface while focusing on front-end development skills.

Key Features:

- Homepage Layout: Mimics Instagram's feed with a grid layout for posts.
- Profile Page: Designed to resemble a user profile with a bio, posts, and followers count.
Navigation Bar: Includes a responsive navigation bar for easy access to different sections.
Post Styling: Implements typical Instagram post styles, including images, captions, and like/comment buttons.
